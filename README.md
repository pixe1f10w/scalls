# Sinatra Calls

A little application that's showcasing usage of:
* sinatra
* [sinatra-diskcache](http://github.com/pixe1f10w/sinatra-diskcache) gem
* sprockets/assets pipeline
* memcaching
* xls report generation using spreadsheet gem
* sass with bootstrap-sass
* haml templates
* some jquery and spin.js code
* capistrano deployment on unicorn server
* etc.

You're probably won't be intrested in functional side of this application, it can be useful only as example code source or a pretty complex sinatra application boilerplate for everyone except me.

All messages in app are in russian, excuse me. :)
